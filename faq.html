  <h3><a href="#is-it-possible-to-open-an-account-in-the-country-and-operate-the-account-while-out-of-the-country" id="#is-it-possible-to-open-an-account-in-the-country-and-operate-the-account-while-out-of-the-country">Online Banking Services are down for maintenance for a short period of time during the weekends. Why is that?</a></h3>
  <p>As part of our normal processing, Online Banking Services are unavailable for a short period during the weekends when transactions are updated. Knowing how important Online Banking is to our Customers, these updates are typically completed during the overnight hours to minimize the impact to our Online Banking users. The delays that we've experienced recently have required us to conduct system maintenance at other times of the day so that transaction updates can be made.</p>

  <p>Many of our Customers have had questions about their accounts and have called our call center. This has led to unusual call volumes which have created longer than normal wait times. We have added additional staff, opened our stores earlier, and taken other steps to improve our ability to take our Customers' calls and questions.</p>
